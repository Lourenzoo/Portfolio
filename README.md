## About
This is a static portfolio site where I have shared information about myself and the projects I have built on this [path](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/front-end-engineer)&#129299;. Working on this project helped cover a portion of what had already been considered, prompting me to revisit theoretical materials and search for additional information.

## Features:
In this project, I aimed to leverage my existing skills in *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JS*. Specifically, I incorporated a touch of interactivity using CSS and implemented a *"burger" menu* for the mobile version, along with a *"scroll-up" button* using JS. Also, you can enjoy some "Disco" by hovering over the photo in the About section or using the mouse wheel to change the border color of the image &#128513;.
